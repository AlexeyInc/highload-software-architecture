Taking into account the approximate actual expenses of GitHub at the time of its acquisition by Microsoft, and assuming they have not significantly increased (apart from minimal salary growth for employees and larger investments in R&D).

For revenue calculations, I used the monthly subscription costs for Team and Enterprise Customers, which were $4 and $21 per month, respectively (these are the only public data available as of October 2017, sourced from this website: https://craft.co/github/operating-metrics).

I assumed an average user growth rate of 5%. Thus, starting from October 2017, the number of users on the Team subscription was approximately 4 million, while the number of Enterprise Customers was about 1.65 million.

Based on the main expense categories (OPEX, CAPEX, and TAXES) and revenue from subscriptions, I calculated that GitHub would break even and start generating profit approximately in 2027 (see the chart on the “Params” tab).
