## Overview

Describe solution that solves peak loadings problem for biggest european football website https://goal.com 

1. Analyze all types of pages on the site
2. Analyze and list possible sources of peak loadings
3. Describe possible solution for each type 

___

## Analysis of page types

1. Homepage – displays trending news, match results, and live updates.
2. Live match pages – show live scores, commentary, and stats.
3. News articles – static articles about transfers, player interviews, etc.
4. Video & multimedia pages – highlights, interviews, and analysis videos.
5. User interaction pages – forums, comments, and user-generated content.

## Analysis of possible peak loading sources

| Page type | Potential peak loading sources|
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Homepage**          | - High simultaneous traffic at peak times (match start, halftime, full-time)  <br> - Regular bot scraping for news  <br> - Push notifications triggering user influx |
| **Live match pages**   | - Concurrent users accessing real-time data  <br> - External bots scraping data  <br> - External attacks attempting DDoS |
| **News articles**      | - Sudden traffic spikes after social media shares  <br> - Bots crawling for content  <br> - Push notifications triggering traffic surges |
| **Video & multimedia** | - Any high concurrent video streaming  <br> - CDN inefficiencies during peak times  <br> - External embedding generating uncontrolled traffic |
| **User interaction pages** | - Burst of comments during big events  <br> - Spambots flooding forums  <br> - API request spikes due to notifications and user interactions |

## Solutions to peak loadings for each page type

**Homepage**

**Sources:** Simultaneous user surges, bot traffic, push notifications
**Solution:**
- CDN Optimization: Cache most homepage components (except live updates) to reduce backend load.
- Push notification load balancing: Spread push notifications in batches over time instead of sending them all at once.
- Rate Limiting Bots: Implement stricter rate limits for non-logged-in users and suspected bots.
- Edge Caching & Prefetching: Use a CDN with edge caching to serve static content efficiently.

**Live Match Pages**

**Sources:** High concurrent access, live updates API calls, bot scraping, DDoS threats
**Solution:**
- Event-Based Caching: Cache live match updates for a few seconds before refreshing to reduce API pressure.
- WebSockets Instead of Polling: Use WebSockets instead of frequent API polling for live updates to decrease server load.
- Bot & Attack Prevention: Implement CAPTCHA for unknown users, analyze suspicious traffic patterns, and block suspected bots early.
- Elastic Scaling: Auto-scale backend services only during predicted match times.

**News Articles**

**Sources:** Social media spikes, bot crawling, push notifications
**Solution:**
- Static pre-rendering: Serve popular articles as pre-rendered static pages to avoid repeated backend rendering.  
- Load-Sensitive push distribution: Send notifications in a staggered manner instead of all at once.  
- CDN cache invalidation strategy: Keep articles cached longer but invalidate them smartly when updated.  

**Video & Multimedia Pages**

**Sources:** High concurrent streaming, CDN inefficiencies, external embedding
**Solution:**
- Adaptive streaming: Use hls/dash streaming to serve different quality levels based on user bandwidth.  
- CDN optimization: Use multiple cdn providers and distribute video caching to prevent overload.  
- Referrer restriction: Block external embedding of videos from unknown sources to prevent uncontrolled spikes.  


**User Interaction Pages**

**Sources:** Mass comments, spambots, API spikes
**Solution:**
- Comment caching: Cache new comments for a few seconds before writing to the database in bulk.  
- Spambot detection: Use ai-based spam filtering to block excessive or repetitive comments.  
- Rate-Limited api requests: Implement per-user rate limits on interactions to prevent overload.

### Generic system-Wide approaches

To further enhance resilience against peak loading:
1.	Predictive scaling: Analyze historical traffic data to scale servers just before expected spikes.  
2.	Serverless functions: Offload lightweight tasks (e.g., real-time stats updates) to serverless architectures.  
3.	Efficient database indexing: Optimize queries to ensure the database handles read-heavy traffic efficiently.  
4.	Load balancing strategies: Implement weighted round-robin or least-connection load balancing to distribute traffic evenly.
