Made 3 stress tests:
1. **100 requests** at 19:30 (**Concurrency 10**; time taken 0.174 seconds) 
2. **1000 requests** at 19:35 (**Concurrency 10**; time taken 0.890 seconds) 
3. **1000 requests** at 19:40 (**Concurrency 20**; time taken 1.471 seconds - higher concurrency doesnâ€™t always lead to better results)
