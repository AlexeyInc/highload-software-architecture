## Project Overview

This project focuses on setting up a monitoring system using the TIG stack (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana) to track the performance and health of a web application infrastructure that includes:
- MongoDB
- Elasticsearch
- Application container (Golang)
- Nginx

**Architecture & Workflow:**
1. Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to the application container.
2. The application container processes requests and interacts with MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
3. Telegraf collects system and service metrics, sending them to InfluxDB for storage.
4. Grafana visualizes the collected data, providing real-time monitoring dashboards.
5. Load testing is conducted using ab (Apache Benchmark) or siege to simulate traffic and validate monitoring accuracy.

Made 3 stress tests:
1. **100 requests** at 19:30 (**Concurrency 10**; time taken 0.174 seconds) 
2. **1000 requests** at 19:35 (**Concurrency 10**; time taken 0.890 seconds) 
3. **1000 requests** at 19:40 (**Concurrency 20**; time taken 1.471 seconds - higher concurrency doesnâ€™t always lead to better results)
