Test External Recomputation Cache

curl "http://localhost:8080/cache/recompute"

	•	1st request: Takes 2 seconds (no cache, recompute needed).
	•	2nd request: Instant response (cached).
	•	After TTL expires (~60s), recompute happens again in the background.


Test Probabilistic Early Expiration Cache

curl "http://localhost:8080/cache/probabilistic"
-	TTL is randomized → Some keys expire earlier than others.
	•	Prevents cache stampede when many users request expiring keys simultaneously.
